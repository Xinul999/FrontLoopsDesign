  <!--
    Welcome to your first FrontLoops challenge.
    Today we gonna build a neat landing page for Apple Watch.
    Just try to do your best and use the techniques from previous lessons.

    Good luck!

    P.S.:
    If you want some more - try splitting your css into several files
    (one file for each design element like button, search input etc.)
    and use @import to get them combined in the main.css file.
